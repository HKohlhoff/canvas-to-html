# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to Canvas HTML Exporter are documented here.
The format follows the spirit of Keep a Changelog, with the newest release
first.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.2] – 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Keep keyboard focus inside search while it is open and restore focus when
  it closes; cancelling the folder picker now ends the selection cleanly.

- Show the update description once for each plugin version, including
  maintenance updates; keep the read marker tied to closing the dialog.
- Prevent overlapping exports from mixing files in the same output folder.
- Close plugin-owned dialogs on disable and serialize settings writes without
  overwriting data from a newer, unsupported schema.
- Keep literal script-closing text inert in exported HTML and prevent
  executable navigation schemes in Markdown links and link-node previews.
- Preserve absolute binary-asset destinations, Vault-root output, Windows drive
  roots and UNC paths.
- Resolve internal note links and asset embeds in text nodes as well as file
  nodes.
- Keep cyclic note links navigable in single HTML, terminate recursive section
  embeds, and give same-name PDF viewers distinct portable filenames.
- Keep folding available for Canvases containing only groups.

### Development

- Split the renderer into document, Markdown, node, theme, stylesheet and
  browser modules while preserving its public import paths and standalone output.

- Preserve existing release artifacts after a failed build, require an explicit
  deployment destination, and reject release tags that differ from the manifest.
- Update the vulnerable development dependency `fast-uri` to 3.1.7 and add
  focused export, lifecycle, path and build regressions.

## [1.3.1] – 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- Hide a collapsed parent's focus control until its branch is expanded again,
  matching Canvas Folding and leaving the complete node-control area to the
  folding count.

### Changed

- Keep the 1.3.0 Advanced Canvas feature description as **Show last update**
  for this maintenance release instead of reopening it after the update.

## [1.3.0] – 2026-08-29

### Added

- Add a local, Markdown-rendered **Show readme** action to the About settings
  without creating a Vault file or loading README images from the network;
  retain the Ko-fi destination as a text link and omit other images without
  placeholder notices.
- Keep the embedded README compact, combine its Canvas comparison into one
  sentence and omit the oversized single-HTML example link from this view.
- Document the manually tested Windows 11 and macOS platforms.
- Preserve supported Advanced Canvas node shapes, borders, text alignment,
  edge paths, edge heads, palette colors, and custom colors without requiring
  Advanced Canvas at export or viewing time.
- Add independent browser collapse controls for saved Advanced Canvas groups,
  including nested groups, title-only collapsed presentation, incident edges,
  search, minimap, fit/reset, and restore behavior.
- Add the self-contained `Advanced Canvas Attributes.canvas` to the public
  demo vault as a complete visual and interaction example.

### Changed

- Remove the redundant tracked maintainer TestVault copy. The public
  `examples/demo-vault/` remains the versioned manual-test source, while local
  cross-plugin testing uses the shared external PluginTests Vault.
- Sample the active Canvas default edge color during export so theme CSS,
  Style Settings values, and enabled CSS snippets are reflected when no color
  is explicitly stored.
- Count hidden directed groups and their geometrically contained nodes and
  groups consistently in browser folding controls.

## [1.2.0] – 2026-08-28

### Added

- Add optional import of the current Canvas Folding state with a fully expanded
  fallback when Canvas Folding is unavailable.
- Add browser controls for individual branches, expand/collapse all, visible
  levels, imported-state restore, no-folding mode, and branch focus.
- Add separate hidden-node and hidden-group counts to the exported page.
- Add visibility-aware fit/reset and a stronger yellow search-result highlight.
- Add an always-available area-zoom gesture for fitting a rectangle selected
  with the left mouse button, including an `Esc` cancel hint while dragging.
- Add a one-time Markdown-rendered feature update view that disappears when
  closed and leaves no note in the Vault.
- Add **Show last update** at the bottom of the settings and keep the same
  user-facing text in `Last Update.md` in the repository.
- Add `No folding` as a third setting and make it the default for exports.
- Add separate menu toggles for branch-control and focus-control visibility.
- Show the number of hidden descendant nodes in expandable branch controls and
  let multi-digit controls grow without covering the focus control.

### Changed

- Make branch focus available on nodes without children, keep geometrically
  contained items active when focusing a group, and let focused-node reset/fit
  ignore surrounding group bounds.
- Keep nodes outside branch focus visible at 20% opacity and use the same focus
  icon as Canvas Folding.
- Size the Canvas viewport from the actual toolbar and heading area so short
  browser windows keep the top of the fitted Canvas visible.
- Store settings and one-time UI state in a versioned plugin-data envelope with
  migration from legacy top-level settings.
- Recommend package exports for large or media-heavy Canvases while retaining
  single HTML as the convenient one-file sharing option.
- Explain that exported HTML remains hidden in Obsidian's file tree unless the
  current Vault enables **Obsidian Settings → Files and links → Detect all file
  extensions**, which is an Obsidian Vault setting rather than a plugin setting.
- Require a compact Windows smoke test for both export formats before release.
- Keep shared descendants visible while another open parent branch still
  reaches them, hiding only the connections belonging to the collapsed branch.
- Treat groups connected through directed edges like regular folding nodes and
  provide focus controls on visible groups.
- Align group visibility with Canvas Folding: connected group frames follow
  their own directed branch, folded groups hide geometrically contained nodes,
  and unrelated contained branches do not hide the group frame.
- Keep a visible branch control in place but disabled while every descendant is
  hidden by a folded group, preserving its state until the group is expanded.

### Fixed

- Keep the exporter version embedded in generated HTML synchronized with the
  plugin release version.
- Keep node-control backgrounds opaque on hover so underlying headings do not
  reduce the controls' contrast.

### Development

- Prepare the project structure, role-based review workflow, manual test matrix
  and release checklist for the optional Canvas Folding integration.
- Update the supported development toolchain, Obsidian lint coverage, CI
  runtimes and automated release-metadata checks.
- Add Obsidian's standard funding metadata and refresh published-installation
  wording.
- Keep the completed integration isolated on
  `feature/canvas-folding-integration` until review and release approval.
